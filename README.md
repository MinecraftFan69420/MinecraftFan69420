# All About Me

## Sup!
I'm **MinecraftFan69420**! I have a family of five, including two siblings (me exclusive), or three (me inclusive). 
I have a discord account in case anyone wanna message me. The name's... also MinecraftFan69420. Lame!

## My likes!
- Minecraft. My favorite game (well duh, that's why I'm MinecraftFan69420!).
- Roblox. Second place in my fav games.
- JavaScript. It was the first programming language I ever learnt!
- HTML & CSS. With JS, they make a perfect trio!
- Python. It's such a simple language!
- Incremental Mass Rewritten. It's my favorite incremental game!
- Tennis Ball from Battle for Dream Island.
  
## My repos!
- Card Incremental. My incremental game!
- Fibonacci. An old code piece!
- Comic Haven. **The only** place you can see my comics! The art may be a bit horrible but alright.
